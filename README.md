# Welcome to Cryptopus

Cryptopus is a Ruby on Rails web application for storing and sharing
passwords and other sensitive data.
All data is stored encrypted in a database, safe from third party access.
A password manager is used to encrypt data and manage users and usergroups.

Cryptopus combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

# Key Features
### Credential management
- Cryptopus lets you store your credentials with options for userame, email, password, pin, token or
  a custom attribute.
- To generate your password for a new account we provide you with a built-in password generator with
  customizable option like length or use of special characters.
- Since we want to increase the awarness to cyber security we ship our password generator with a
  evaluation system which evaluates your password and tells you how secure it is.
- Last but not least we enable standard copy actions for an efficient login.

### Sharing
- With our transfer algorithm we support sharing passwords with other users or teams.
- Similar to our credential sharing service it is possible to share files with other members or
  even add them to a credential if necessary.

### OpenID Connect
- With Version > 3.6 Cryptopus supports Single-Sign-On (SSO) with OpenID Connect / Keycloak for
  simple logins => fast, easy, secure!

### Translations
- As one of the only cryptographic tools on the market, we now provide translations for Swissgerman
  which follows the implementation of German, French and English

### Support
- With one of the most known and most prestigious projects we assure you that this
  project will never run out of support.
- New features and updates are going to be implemented and published in this repository, so
  stay in touch!

# Warning!

Putting all your passwords in a database accessible over the internet
might be a relevant security threat. Most critical for your data's safety is

- strong root and user passwords (!!)
- a SSL-secured connection (never use an unecrypted connection!)
- internal network only access (vpn)

Remember, Cryptopus won't make your passwords more secure.
It simply gives you the possibility to manage them in a nice way,
store them in a safe manner and share them with other people if you wish to do so.

_Under no circumstances can we be held liable for password theft,
lost passwords or any other inconvenience caused by using cryptopus._
