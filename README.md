Welcome to Cryptopus
====================

Cryptopus is a Ruby on Rails web application for storing and sharing
passwords and other sensitive data. 
All data is stored encrypted in a database, safe from third party access. 
A password manager is used to encrypt data and manage users and usergroups.

Cryptopus combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

Learn more about Cryptopus on our [wiki](https://github.com/puzzle/cryptopus/wiki) page.

Development

Warning!
========

Putting all your passwords in a database accessible over the internet 
might be a relevant security threat. Most critical for your data's safety is

- strong root and user passwords (!!)
- a SSL-secured connection (never use an unecrypted connection!)
- internal network only access (vpn)

Remember, Cryptopus won't make your passwords more secure.
It simply gives you the possibility to manage them in a nice way,
store them in a safe manner and share them with other people if you wish to do so.

*Under no circumstances can we be held liable for password theft,
lost passwords or any other inconvenience caused by using cryptopus.*
